# Nepali Food Vision

This a simple model that classifies various classes of nepali food based on their picture. First challenge of this project was to find the dataset. Unfortunately I could not find any
dataset that consists of Nepali food. So, I scraped google and created simple dataset consisting of 9 classes. I have made this data public in Kaggle.

## Motivation

When going through tensorflow deep learning course taught by Daniel Bourke, I stumbled upon project called FoodVision. After completing that project, I wanted to make similar one
but with Nepali cuisines. I could not find any dataset. So, I decided to scrap google and create my own dataset. Then I experimented with various custom model as well as
fine tuned existing model using Tensorflow.
